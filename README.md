A Tom & Jerry–themed endless dodging game built with C# and MonoGame
Dino Land is a fast‑paced endless survival game inspired by the classic Tom & Jerry chase dynamic. You play as Tom, trying to dodge Jerry and the bulldog as they charge at you from unpredictable directions. Enemies spawn from any edge of the screen, travel in straight lines, exit the screen, and re‑enter from a new random position — keeping the pressure high and the gameplay unpredictable.
Collect cheese to increase your score and survive as long as you can. There is no winning, only lasting longer than your last run.
